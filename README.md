#Using Python to import a Pandas Dataframe into (Google) Cloud database

Here I'm showing how easily you can use Python to connect to Cloud services, create databases and tables and update them as the new data points arrive. 
I'm also showing my way of thinking throught the process. At first you may find it messy since Jupyter Notebooks allows to execute code at cell level which helps understanding the problem, but with each commit I will try to reiterate on the shortcomings of previous, till my final version.
